# Summary

## Core Synopsis

The core feedback is a diagnosis: the presenter's project pitch failed because it conflated terminology from multiple, distinct domains—AI fairness, clinical diagnostics, and quantum computing—without establishing a clear, unified context. This created a communication breakdown, as the audience could not discern the project's actual goal, scope, or methodology. The proposed solution is to radically simplify the narrative by first defining a single, generic problem (e.g., creating a "fair contextual bandit"), and only then applying it to specific, well-defined domains as case studies. This structural change is critical to transforming the pitch from a confusing amalgam of concepts into a clear, defensible research proposal.

## The Diagnostic & The Prescription

### 1. The Breakdown in Communication
The central issue identified is a lack of clarity stemming from undisciplined use of terminology. The presenter's attempt to bridge multiple complex fields resulted in a narrative that was impossible to follow.
- **Ambiguous Language**: The term "diagnostics" was used without specifying its context, leading to confusion between medical diagnostics and system diagnostics.
- **Conflated Domains**: The project simultaneously referenced fairness in clinical settings, resource allocation in quantum computing, and natural language inference, without explaining the connection.
- **Unclear Application**: The audience could not understand how a concept like "fairness" would apply to a domain like "Parkview" (a quantum computing context) in the same way it applies to clinical data.

### 2. The Strategic Prescription: Isolate and Conquer
The feedback coalesced around a clear, structured approach to reframing the project narrative for intelligibility and impact.
- **Step 1: Define the Core Tool**: Start by establishing the central, domain-agnostic contribution. For example: "The goal is to design a generic, fair contextual bandit." This anchors the entire discussion.
- **Step 2: Demonstrate the Problem**: Show that existing methods in specific target domains are unfair. Use clear metrics to prove the existence of a "fairness gap" in each domain before introducing the solution.
- **Step 3: Apply the Tool to Target Domains**: Frame the clinical and quantum applications as distinct case studies. This allows the presenter to keep the discussion of different domains separate, making the logic easier to follow (e.g., "Now, we will apply this fair bandit to two target domains: clinical trial data and quantum resource allocation.").

### 3. Tactical Adjustments for Professionalism
A final layer of feedback focused on improving the document's tone and formatting to align with academic or professional standards.
- **Adopt Formal Voice**: Shift from first-person ("my goal," "I think") to a more objective, third-person perspective ("The goal of this project is..."). This enhances the work's perceived professionalism.
- **Eliminate Insider Jargon**: Remove internal-facing references like course codes ("IST 780") or mentions of it being a class project. Instead of abbreviating, the guidance is to state the work being built upon directly (e.g., "This work builds on the principles from 'Operationalizing Fairness...' [citation]").

## Next Move

**@Speaker 3**:
- [ ] Restructure the project narrative to first define the core "fair contextual bandit" tool, then apply it to separate case studies (clinical, quantum) - [TBD]
- [ ] For each case study, first establish a domain-specific fairness metric, then show how existing methods fail against that metric - [TBD]
- [ ] Revise the project document to use a formal, third-person voice, removing personal pronouns like "I" and "my" - [TBD]
- [ ] Remove all internal references (e.g., course codes) and replace them with formal citations or descriptive language about the prior work - [TBD]
